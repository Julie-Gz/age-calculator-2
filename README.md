# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a great project to practice conditional statements and flow control. 
I also learned how to add fonts to the stylesheet using the @font-face property.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "poppinsBoldItalic";
    src: url("assets/fonts/Poppins-BoldItalic.ttf") format("truetype");
}
```

### Continued development

Would like to try the bonus challenge and learn more about accessibility and form validation.
